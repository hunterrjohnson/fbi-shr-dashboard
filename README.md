# fbi-shr-dashboard

This project creates a dashboard using data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Supplementary Homicide Reports from 1985 through 2019. Currently, the dashboard only includes offender/victim demographic data. In the future, this dashboard will include more information regarding homicide circumstances including offender/victim relationship.

The dashboard is produced using R Shiny and the shinydashboard package.
