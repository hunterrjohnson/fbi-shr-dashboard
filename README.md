# fbi-shr-dashboard

This project creates a dashboard using data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Supplementary Homicide Reports from 1985 through 2019. The dashboard includes data on victim/offender demographics, victim/offender relationship, weapon used, and homicide circumstances.

The dashboard is produced using R Shiny and the shinydashboard package.
